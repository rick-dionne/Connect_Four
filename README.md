# Connect 4 Project
## Purpose
To practice my Python skills and test 
various approaches to computer intelligence,
I will implement the simple game of 
Connect Four and a variety of game-playing
algorithms. This project is largely an exercise
in teaching myself good coding practices
and exposing myself to new methods in 
designing "artificial intelligence."
## Goals
1. Implement Connect Four in Python.
2. Create a basic GUI for human play and
to facilitate future testing against computer
players.
3. Implement a "good old-fashioned" AI 
that uses MiniMax tree search with alpha-beta
pruning as a baseline for computer skill.
4. Implement computer players with 
neural networks and test a variety of machine
learning approaches.
## Current Progress
Currently working on step 1: baseline 
implementation of Connect Four.
## Credits
All work is by me, using the JetBrains 
PyCharm IDE. I plan to use PyTorch
as a framework for implementing machine
learning.
